## [1.9.0] - 2026-06-08

### Features

- **Robust abort handling** - Rewrote the aborting system; sync tools, loop execution, and LLM clients now correctly respect task abort signals (`ctx.signal`). Also decoupled `AbortError` from `InvokeError` in `@page-agent/llms`.
- **Claude Opus 4.8 support** - Added support for Claude Opus 4.8 model.

### Improvements

- **Concurrency guard** - Prevented concurrent `execute()` calls on a single PageAgent/Core instance to avoid race conditions.
- **Model recommendations refresh** - Updated default and tested model list recommendations.
- **Test coverage** - Added comprehensive Vitest unit tests for the `@page-agent/llms` package.
- **Improved documentation** - Added website documentation for the `ctx.signal` abort contract and `execute()` concurrency rules.

### Bug Fixes

- **DTS bundle fix** - Fixed a packaging bug where global type declarations were incorrectly bundled into `.d.ts` outputs.
- **Website sidebar fix** - Normalized trailing slashes in the website's sidebar location comparison.

## [1.8.2] - 2026-05-11

### Features

- **IIFE demo control** - Added `showPanel` and `autoInit` switches to the IIFE CDN script to control whether the UI panel automatically displays or initializes on load.

### Improvements

- **Build toolchain modernization** - Upgraded build infrastructure to Vite 8.

### Bug Fixes

- **TypeScript `InvokeErrorType` fix** - Separated the value and type space for `InvokeErrorType` to resolve TypeScript compilation issues.

- **Custom LLM request hook** - Added a `transformRequestBody` hook to allow custom modification of payloads before sending requests to LLM providers.

### Improvements

- **Accessibility (a11y) enhancements** - Added descriptive accessible labels to `ConfigPanel` input fields and icon buttons in compliance with WCAG 4.1.2.
- **UI polish** - Improved `HistoryList` loading and empty states, and added helpful tooltips for actions.
- **Prompt caching guidance** - Added website documentation for prompt caching optimization.
- **Build speedups** - Added parallel build scripts to accelerate local development compilation.

### Bug Fixes

- **DeepSeek tool choice fix** - Disabled explicit `tool_choice` for DeepSeek models to avoid API compatibility errors.
- **MCP version advertising** - MCP server now correctly advertises its package version.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-04-15

### Breaking Changes

- **TypeScript 6 & ESLint 10 upgrade** - Major toolchain modernization. Upgraded the entire monorepo to TypeScript 6 and ESLint 10 with source-first monorepo resolution (library exports resolve to source files directly during local development).

### Improvements

- **MCP security hardening** - Bound the MCP HTTP + WebSocket server to `localhost` only.
- **Extension UI refinement** - Made the history panel height responsive to the viewport and improved the result card readability by increasing font size.

- **Configurable `stepDelay`** - Agent pacing between steps is now configurable via `stepDelay`
- **Optional API key** - `apiKey` can now be omitted for compatible deployments that do not require one
- **Optional named tool choice** - Tool invocation can disable named tool choice for providers that behave better without it
- **Better rich-text input support** - Improved `contenteditable` handling with better event dispatching and `execCommand` fallback for more editors
- **More flexible DOM extraction** - `includeAttributes` now supports wildcards, `contenteditable` is included by default, and heuristically interactive elements expose more useful attributes

---

## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-27

### Features

- Update Terms of Use and Privacy Policy
- **Robust tool-call validation** - Action inputs are now validated against tool schemas individually, producing clear error messages (e.g. `Invalid input for action "click_element_by_index"`) instead of unreadable union parse errors
- **Primitive action input coercion** - Small models that output `{"click_element_by_index": 2}` instead of `{"click_element_by_index": {"index": 2}}` are now auto-corrected using tool schemas
- **Qwen model updates** - Added `qwen3.5-plus` as the default free testing model; disabled `enable_thinking` for Qwen models to avoid incompatible responses
- **Updated default LLM endpoint** - Migrated demo and extension to a new testing endpoint with legacy endpoint auto-migration

### Improvements

- Unified zod imports (`* as z`) across all packages for consistency
- Better Zod error formatting with `z.prettifyError()` in LLM client
- Exported `InvokeError` and `InvokeErrorType` as values (not just types) from `@page-agent/llms`
- Exported `SupportedLanguage` type from `@page-agent/core`

### Extension v0.1.8

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-13

### Breaking Changes

- **Lifecycle: `stop()` vs `dispose()`** - New `stop()` method to cancel the current task while keeping the agent reusable. `dispose()` is now terminal — a disposed agent cannot be reused. This affects both `PageAgentCore` and `PanelAgentAdapter`.

### Features

- **Panel action button** - The panel button now morphs between Stop (■) and Close (X) based on agent status
- **Error history** - Errors and max-step failures are now recorded in `history` as `AgentErrorEvent`, making post-task analysis more complete

### Bug Fixes

- **AbortError handling** - `AbortError` is no longer retried by the LLM client, and shows a clean "Task stopped" message instead of a raw error stack

---

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-11

### Features

- **Observe Phase** - Agent now observes the page before each action, improving decision accuracy on dynamic pages
- **Better Abort Handling** - Improved `abortSignal` support for cleaner task cancellation

### Improvements

- Pruned system prompts for lower token usage and faster responses
- Improved error handling during agent steps with better error messages
- Zod tree-shaking for smaller bundle size

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed indentation lost in DOM extraction caused by `trimLines`
- Fixed `gpt-5-mini` temperature configuration

---

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-02

### Features

- **Custom System Prompt** - New `systemPrompt` config option to customize or extend the default system prompt
- **Chrome Extension** - Extension with multi-tab control, main-world API with token auth, and tab lifecycle management

### Improvements

- Renamed `include_attributes` to `includeAttributes` in PageController config (camelCase consistency)
- Lazy-loaded mask module for faster initialization
- Better date formatting and error messages from LLM client
- Added `rawRequest` to step history for easier debugging

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed CSP errors by using local SVGs for cursor mask instead of inline styles
- Fixed `AbortError` being incorrectly retried and shown to users
- Fixed mask not working correctly when starting a new task after stopping a previous one
